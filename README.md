# Collaborative Filtering Based Recommender System

## Introduction

In today's world, every company wants to provide its customers with personalized recommendations to improve user experience and increase sales. Collaborative Filtering is one of the most popular techniques used in recommender systems to provide personalized recommendations to users. In this blog post, we will discuss Collaborative Filtering and its implementation using code snippets and examples.

## What is Collaborative Filtering?

Collaborative Filtering is a technique used in recommender systems to make predictions about user preferences based on past behavior. It is based on the assumption that if a user has similar behavior to another user, they are likely to have similar preferences. Collaborative Filtering is of two types- User-based and Item-based.

In User-Based Collaborative Filtering, the system recommends items to a user based on the preferences of other users who are similar to that user. In Item-Based Collaborative Filtering, the system recommends items to a user based on the similarity between the items that the user has liked in the past.
